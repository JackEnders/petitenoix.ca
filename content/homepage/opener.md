From freshly squeezed lemons, to single origin chocolate.
Each bite is crafted with layers of handmade tastebud tingling elements. Our kitchen is more of a laboratory experimenting with modern culinary techniques, inspired by traditional French methodology, and infusing flavors from around the globe. 

Petite Noix is currently baked out of Red Brick Cafe, on 8 Douglas St, Guelph, Ontario.
